Complete the following steps:

1. Calculate the average earnings for individuals at the most selective colleges, then compare that with individuals at the least selective colleges in the dataset. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

load("college.Rdata")


```


2. Find a way to determine whether colleges with very high SAT scores tend to be larger or smaller than colleges with low SAT scores. 

3. Plot the relationship between cost and debt. What do you see? Does this surprise you?

4. Now, provide separate plots for cost and debt by control of the institution.
